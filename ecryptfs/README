This is an eCryptfs encrypted filesystem module enhanced to accelearte 
on GPUs, using KCUDA provided by Gdev.
The ecryptfs module is modified to call the ecb_gpu module instead of
the original ecb module. The ecb_gpu module implements AES using KCUDA.
A series of experiments has shown that GPU-accelerated eCryptfs provides
~5x speedup on usual disks, and further acceleration would be obtained
on SSDs.

The following instruct how to install and use GPU-accelerated eCryptfs.
We assume that the system is already setup to use eCryptfs. In Fedora,
for instance, ecryptfs-manger can be used to setup eCryptfs.
The kcuda module must also be loaded.

sudo modprobe xts
sudo modprobe aes # may not be necessary depending on environments
cd ecb
make
sudo insmod ecb_gpu.ko
cd ../ecryptfs
make
sudo insmod ecryptfs.ko
cd $(SOME_TEST_DIRECTORY)
mkdir secret # mount ecryptfs on this directory
sudo mount -t ecryptfs secret secret
cd secret
time dd if=/dev/zero of=./zero bs=1M count=1 # see how fast it is!
cd ..
sudo umount secret
sudo rmmod ecryptfs
sudo rmmod ecb_gpu
